***********************************************************

This is a simple calculator project of data structure coarse.

There are two modes in this calculator:
    1. Polynomial mode
    2. Normal mode

***********************************************************

## POLYNOMIAL MODE:

    ****************
    * introduction *
    ****************

    In this mode, you can perform operations on polynomials.

    You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of two polynomials.

    You can also find the derivative of a polynomial.

    You can also evaluate a polynomial at a given value.

    ****************
    *    example   *
    ****************

        you can omit the () when you do addition or subtraction:
        3x^2 + 2x + 1 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4 = 5x^2 + 5x + 5

        you should add () when you do multiplication:
        (3x^2 + 2x + 1) * (2x^2 + 3x + 4) = 6x^4 + 13x^3 + 14x^2 + 11x + 4

        click ' to find the derivative:
                      click '
        3x^2 + 2x + 1 ====== (3x^2 + 2x + 1)' ====== 6x + 2

        click | or |x= to evaluate the polynomial at a given value:
                     click |x=          input 2 and click =
        3x^2 + 2x + 1  ==== (3x^2 + 2x + 1)|x= ===== 17


***********************************************************

## NORMAL MODE:

    ****************
    * introduction *
    ****************

    In this mode, you can perform basic arithmetic operations.

    You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of two numbers.

    JUST like other calculators you have used before~

***********************************************************

ShortCut:

    (available in both modes)

    Ctrl+Z: undo

    Ctrl+Y: redo

***********************************************************

Technical specification:

    The algorithm part is implemented in C++.

    The user interface is implemented in Qt framework.
